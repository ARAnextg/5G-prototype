Lab: Signal Reflection and Multipath 
=====================================

**Platform:** Software Defined Radios.

..
   **Resources needed:** USRP N320, USRP B210, and a general purpose
   server.

**Resources needed:** 2 x USRP B210s

**Short Description:** Investigate the effects of signal reflection and multipath in wireless communication. 

**Detailed Description:** We will set up a scenario where RF signals transmitted by one USRP undergo reflection and multipath effects before being received by another USRP. 
Using signal processing techniques, they will analyze how these phenomena affect the signal quality. This experiment can include moving the USRPs or introducing obstacles to 
vary the multipath conditions.
