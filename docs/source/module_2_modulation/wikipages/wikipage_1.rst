Understanding Modulation & Demodulation Techniques
===================================================
- key idea: understanding how binary data can be used to manipulate the physical characteristics of electromagnetic waveforms. Basic concepts of digital communication system

- what is digital transmission? The purpose is to achieve data transmissions and reception across some kind of medium, whether it is a twisted pair of copper wires, fiber optic cable, or a wireless environment. The core of any digital transmission system is the binary digit or bit.

- Digital transceiver is essentially responsible for the translation between a stream of digital data represented by bits and electromagnetic waveforms possessing physical characteristics that represent those bits
