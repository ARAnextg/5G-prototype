Lab 3: Frequency Hopping
==========================

Introduction
------------

Frequency Hopping is a technique where the frequency of the transmitted signals changes quickly and randomly over time. Some of the major proâ€™s of doing this is: It helps reduce signal interference, and improves security by making it hard for unauthorized users to intercept or jam signals. In this lab we will take a look at what this might look like.

To Get Started
--------------

-  Python Installed
-  import random
-  import time

	*Example of some Imports.*



If you need assistance on installing Python, i recommend visiting Python.org where you can easily install Python on your computer. Installing python now would be helpful for later labs in the later modules as well. We will also need to import time, and import random for this python script.

Part 1: Creating the Wireless Device Class
------------------------------------------

	*Example of Wireless Device implementation.*



This class simply creates the wireless Device which will have an array of possible frequencies that can be randomly decided to be using at a particular time stamp. In this lab we will simply create just 3 devices with 3 different possible frequencies that they can be adjusted to.

Part 2: Creating the Wireless Network Class
-------------------------------------------

.. figure:: /images/Wireless_Network.png
    :figclass: align-center

	*Example of Wireless Network that is created.*



This class will create a network, in our case we will be using the 3 devices that will transmit their signals, selecting randomly which frequency they will be using at a particular time.

Part 3: Launch the Signal
-------------------------

.. figure:: /images/Transmission.png
    :figclass: align-center

	*Example of a transmission.*



We will launch the transmission for 10 seconds and display the results and watch all of the devices hop to different frequencies randomly.

	*Example of results.*



Conclusion
----------

As mentioned before, this technique can reduce signal interference because of the non fixed frequencies. As well as preventing unauthorized users to do something maliciously to the signals such as jam or intercept the signals.
