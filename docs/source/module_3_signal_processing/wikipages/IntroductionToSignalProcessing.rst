Diving Deeper into Signal Processing
====================================

Importance of Signals
-------------------------
Signals are arguably the most important part of any 5G network foundational component, with the reliable transmission of data happening through radio signal propagation. Signals in their raw form propagate through the air, bouncing off of stationary/moving objects and other signals produced from random sources before arriving at a listening receiver.   

Why Signal Processing is needed for Data Analyzation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Signals, in their essential form, are functions that are represented over time. These signals are most commonly represented as sine waves, which can be plotted in either the time or frequency domain. In SDR and digital signal processing, signals displayed in the time domain are represented in their natural form and samples of signals will be taken directly in the time domain. The frequency domain shows how much of a signal rests in certain frequencies and is used to show different features of a signal that cannot be seen with the time domain. In this module, you will learn about how signals can be converted from time domain to frequency domain and provide a more distinct form for processing and analysis. 

Fourier Transforms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The conversion from time to frequency domain and back is represented mathematically through the Fourier Transform. In this module, you will learn about four members of the fourier transform family: 

- **Fourier Transform:** 

- **Fourier Series:**

- **Discrete Fourier Transform:**
