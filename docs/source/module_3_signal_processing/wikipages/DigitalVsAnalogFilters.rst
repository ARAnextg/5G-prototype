SDR Signal Processing: A Look Into Signal Analyzation
==========================================

Introduction to Signal Processing
---------------------------------

Software Defined Radio (SDR) development requires a strong background in signals/systems, radio frequency (RF), and analog baseband processing. In order to understand the life cycle of a signal being sent, captured, processed, and analyzed, it is
essential to learn about the tools used to process signals (filters) and understand the differences between Digital and Analog filters and the many types that are defined within those categories.

Digital vs. Analog Filters
---------------------------------

There are four filters used with digital signals:

- **Low-pass Filters**: 
  
  - 

- **High-pass Filters**: 
  
  - 

- **Band-pass Filters**: 
  
  - 

- **Band-stop Filters**:
