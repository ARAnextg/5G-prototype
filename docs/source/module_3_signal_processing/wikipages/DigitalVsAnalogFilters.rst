Introduction to Signal Processing
---------------------------------

Software Defined Radio (SDR) development requires a strong background in signals/systems, radio frequency (RF), and analog baseband processing. In order to understand the life cycle of a signal being sent, captured, processed, and analyzed, it is
essential to learn about the tools used to process signals (filters) and understand the differences between Digital and Analog filters and the many types that are defined within those categories.

What are Filters?
-----------------

Filtering is the process of extracting useful signals from jumbles of random noise made up of all kinds of interfering signals. If received noise and useful signals possess different frequency distributions and are both present at the filterâ€™s input, the noise can be attenuated/eliminated while still retaining the useful signal. 


Different Types of Filters
--------------------------

Filters are either Digital or Analog and can be classified as lowpass, highpass, bandpass, and bandstop. Filters are classified according to their frequency responses which discriminate the signal input based on various attributes. 

Digital vs. Analog Filters
---------------------------------

There are four filters used with digital signals:

- **Low-pass Filters**: 
  
  - This filter passes low frequencies but stops higher frequencies. 0 Hz is always in the passband (the range of frequencies a filter lets through).

- **High-pass Filters**: 
  
  - 

- **Band-pass Filters**: 
  
  - 

- **Band-stop Filters**:
