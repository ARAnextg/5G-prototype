Introduction to Signal Processing
---------------------------------

Software Defined Radio (SDR) development requires a strong background in signals/systems, radio frequency (RF), and analog baseband processing. In order to understand the life cycle of a signal being sent, captured, processed, and analyzed, it is
essential to learn about the tools used to process signals (filters) and understand the differences between Digital and Analog filters and the many types that are defined within those categories.

What are Filters?
-----------------

Filtering is the process of extracting useful signals from jumbles of random noise made up of all kinds of interfering signals. There are several different types of filters used (frequency selective circuits) that discriminate the input based on various attributes. If received noise and useful signals possess different frequency distributions and are both present at the filterâ€™s input, the noise can be attenuated/eliminated while still retaining the useful signal.


Different Types of Filters
--------------------------

Filters can be classified as lowpass, highpass, bandpass, and bandstop according to their frequency responses and according to the signal a filter deals with, it can be classified as an analog or digital filter. 

Digital vs. Analog Filters
---------------------------------

There are four filters used with digital signals:

- **Low-pass Filters**: 
  
  - 

- **High-pass Filters**: 
  
  - 

- **Band-pass Filters**:

- **Band-stop Filters**:
