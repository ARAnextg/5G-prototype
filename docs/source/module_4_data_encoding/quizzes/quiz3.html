    <p>3. How does error detection work in 5G networks?</p>
    <input type="radio" name="q3" value="a" id="q3a"> <label for="q3a">A. The trailer of a packet in 5G networks typically contains a cyclic redundancy check (CRC), which is used to detect any errors that might have occurred during the transmission of the packet.

The header of a packet in 5G networks typically contains a cyclic redundancy check (CRC), which is used to detect any errors that might have occurred during the transmission of the packet. If the receiving device calculates a different CRC than the one contained in the header, it knows that the packet was corrupted during transmission.</label><br>
    <input type="radio" name="q3" value="c" id="q3c"> <label for="q3c">C. The trailer of a packet in 5G networks typically contains a cyclic redundancy check (CRC), which is used to detect any errors that might have occurred during the transmission of the packet. If the receiving device calculates the same CRC as the one contained in the trailer, it knows that the packet was corrupted during transmission.</label><br>
