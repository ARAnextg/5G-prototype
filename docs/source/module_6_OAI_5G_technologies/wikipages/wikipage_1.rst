OpenAirInterface (OAI) and 5G Technologies
=============================================

Background and history of OAI and why it was created
-----------------------------------------------------
OpenAirInterface (OAI) is an open-source project that implements the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) technology on general-purpose x86 computing hardware and Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Software Defined Radio (SDR) cards. It was created by the Mobile Communications Department at EURECOM to enable innovation in the area of mobile/wireless. The OAI source code is split into two projects: OAI Radio Access Network (OAI-RAN) and OAI Core Network (OAI-CN), each residing in separate repositories and distributed under separate licenses. OAI distinguishes itself from other similar projects through its unique open-source license, the OAI public license v1.1, which was created by the OAI Software Alliance (OSA) in 2017. This initiative has democratized innovation in the 5G era resulting in it becoming an ideal platform for both industrial and academic research.

OpenAirInterface (OAI)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- An open-source project initiated by the Mobile Communications Department at EURECOM.

- Provides a 3GPP compliant reference implementation of key elements of 4G and 5G Radio Access Network (RAN) and core network.

- Allows users to set up a compliant 4G/5G network and inter-operate with commercial equipment.

Implementation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Implements 3GPP technology on general-purpose x86 computing hardware and Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Software Defined Radio (SDR) cards.

- Main goal was to develop access solutions for networks, radio, and core networks.

Unique Aspects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Open-source license, the OAI public license v1.1, created by the OAI Software Alliance (OSA) in 2017.
- License allows contributing parties to make patent licenses available to third parties under Fair, Reasonable And Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) terms.
- OAI code is free for non-commercial/academic research purposes.

Creation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Driven by the need to democratize innovation in the 5G era.
- Makes it possible to deploy and operate a 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network today and 5G New Radio (NR) networks in the future at a very low cost.
- Open-source code can be adapted to different use cases and deployment, and new functionality can be implemented.

OAI Software
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Split into two projects: OAI Radio Access Network (OAI-RAN) and OAI Core Network (OAI-CN).
- OAI-RAN project implements 4G LTE and 5G Radio Access Network.
- OAI-CN project implements 4G LTE Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and 5G Core Network.


OAI Community
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Fast-growing community with massive 5G enabled government, academic, and research use cases.
- Supports research, prototype system development, and system integration.
- OAI Software Alliance (OSA) is a non-profit consortium fostering a community of industrial as well as research contributors.

OAI Public License V1.1:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- A modified version of Apache V2.0 License.
- Allows companies/individuals which own significant portfolio of patents to be able to contribute to the OAI source code and still be able to keep their patent rights.
- All the contributors of ideas, code or documentation of OAI projects sign an Individual Contributor License agreement (ICLA).

Future of OAI:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Development of new features for what will become the 5G network.
- The OAI community is invited to refer to the roadmap that gives the sequencing and the timeline for the availability of different functions of a 3GPP compliant 5G core
