How OpenAirInterface (OAI) Works and Its Advantages/Disadvantages
==================================================================

How Does OAI Work?
------------------

OpenAirInterface (OAI) is an open-source platform providing a software-based implementation of the 3GPP protocol stack for the Radio Access Network (RAN) and the Core Network. OAI's flexibility makes it a powerful tool for building and testing 4G LTE and 5G systems.

Components of OAI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Radio Access Network (RAN)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**5G RAN Project**:
  Develops a 5G software stack for both Non-Stand-Alone (NSA) and Stand-Alone (SA) modes, including gNodeB and UE functionalities.

**Simulation Frameworks**:
  Includes L1-simulation (RF simulator replaces the radio board) and L2-simulation (connects OAI UE with OAI xNB via nFAPI).

**CU/DU Split**:
  Supports control plane and user plane traffic management in 5G SA mode using the OAI RFsimulator.

Core Network
^^^^^^^^^^^^

**5G Core Network (CN)**:
  Provides a 3GPP-Compliant 5G SA Core Network implementation supporting a service-oriented architecture (SBA) with functions like AMF, SMF, UPF, NRF, AUSF, UDM, UDR, and NSSF.

**Deployment Modes**:
  Adapts to various use-case scenarios with different deployment options for the User Plane.
